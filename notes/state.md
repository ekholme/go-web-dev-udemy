# Creating State

## Redirects

- URL = uniform resource locator.
- Redirects are fairly straightforward -- a client makes a request to a server at a certain resource (URL), and then the server redirects the client to a different location.
- Note that statuses in the 300s are specific to redirects
- If you provide a 301 status code ("moved permanently"), most browsers will remember where you're redirected to and won't go back to the original request path.
