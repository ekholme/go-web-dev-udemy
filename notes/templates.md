# Text Templates
 - 'parsing' a file means reading it into a program
 - file extension doesn't really matter when reading into go (for text templates)
 - a pointer to a template is a "container" into which all templates get parsed and are held. Todd's words -- obv not technical
 - see a very basic example of parsing and printing a text template in `templates/02/...`
